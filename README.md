# SQL Practice Problems

A repo for sql practice problems. This has the following folders:

`heros`: two databases about heros with problems and solutions  
`matrix_mult`: a database to test matrix multiplication with sql

All databases are designed for PostgreSQL.

To create a database from the sql files run `psql -f db_name.sql` in the command line, where `db_name` is the database name.

If you don't want to install postgres on your own computer then you can
copy and paste the correct portion from the sql files into
[Sqlfiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com) and practice the problems there.

Pull requests welcome!
