# Solutions to 'Heros' problems

There are currently no solutions to these problems :(  
Pull requests welcome!

## How many superheros are there?

## How many of each type are there currently? Include whether they are good or bad.

## Compare the numbers at the end of the year to the beginning of the year. (You can assume beginning of the year has FromDate = NULL and the end of the year as ToDate = NULL)

## Which leaders had at least one follower? Order from highest number of followers to lowest.

## How many times did people change from good to evil (or vice versa)?

## Do you get more promotions (sidekick -> hero vs. crony -> villain ) on the good side or the bad side?

## Which happens more often? Civilians going to the good or the bad side? (Donâ€™t count retirement).
